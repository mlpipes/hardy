 Tips for getting started:

 1. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 2. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 3. ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> /init is analyzing your codebase… 

⏺ I'll analyze your codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file to help future
  instances of Claude Code work effectively in this repository.

⏺ I've created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for your MLPipes Auth Service.
   The file includes:

  Key Development Commands:
  - Development server, testing, linting, database operations, and Docker
  commands
  - Specific ports (3001 for auth service, 5433 for database)

  Architecture Overview:
  - Multi-tenant healthcare authentication with HIPAA compliance
  - Better Auth with tRPC for type-safe APIs
  - Row-level security for tenant isolation
  - Comprehensive audit logging

  Important Technical Details:
  - Multi-tenant data access patterns
  - Authentication flow with various methods (2FA, passkeys, magic links)
  - Healthcare-specific features (SMART on FHIR, NPI numbers)
  - Security middleware chain and rate limiting

  Development Workflow:
  - Database migration process
  - API endpoint creation patterns
  - Testing requirements (80% coverage threshold)
  - Environment variable configuration

  The file focuses on the architectural patterns and specific workflows that
   would be difficult to discover without reading multiple files,
  particularly the multi-tenant isolation mechanism and healthcare
  compliance features.

> for an intermediate full stack developer such as myself, do you think this
   is an overly ambitious project to do?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to evaluate whether the MVP plan we've created is 
  too ambitious for an intermediate full-stack developer. I need to give an 
  honest assessment considering:

  1. The scope of the MVP we've defined
  2. The complexity of the technologies involved
  3. The compliance requirements
  4. The 6-8 week timeline
  5. The fact that they'll be working mostly solo

  Let me think about this carefully and provide a balanced, helpful 
  response.

⏺ I need to be honest with you - this is indeed an ambitious project, but
  not necessarily overly so. Let me break down why:

  Challenging Aspects for an Intermediate Developer:

  1. Multi-Tenant Row-Level Security (RLS)
  - This is genuinely complex and easy to get wrong
  - One mistake could expose data across tenants
  - Requires deep PostgreSQL knowledge

  2. Healthcare Compliance Requirements
  - HIPAA compliance has strict requirements
  - Audit logging must be comprehensive
  - Security mistakes have serious consequences

  3. Better Auth Integration
  - While Better Auth simplifies auth, customizing it for healthcare needs
  requires understanding its internals
  - The plugin system and middleware stack add complexity

  4. Full-Stack Scope
  - You're building backend (tRPC, Prisma), frontend (Next.js), database
  (PostgreSQL), and DevOps (Docker)
  - That's a lot of moving parts for one person

  Why It Might Still Be Achievable:

  1. You're Building on Better Auth
  - You're not creating auth from scratch
  - Better Auth handles the complex crypto and session management
  - You're mainly extending it with healthcare features

  2. The Tech Stack is Modern and Well-Documented
  - Next.js, Prisma, and tRPC have excellent docs
  - Strong TypeScript throughout catches many errors
  - Active communities for help

  3. MVP Scope is Focused
  - We've excluded advanced features (passkeys, SMART on FHIR)
  - Core features are well-understood patterns
  - 6-8 weeks is reasonable for this scope

  My Recommendations:

  1. Consider Phasing Even More Aggressively

  Start with an even smaller MVP:
  - Week 1-2: Just email/password auth with Better Auth
  - Week 3-4: Add tenant isolation (most critical part)
  - Week 5-6: Add audit logging and basic admin
  - Then iterate from there

  2. Get Help on Critical Parts

  Consider getting expert review for:
  - RLS implementation (hire a PostgreSQL expert for a few hours)
  - Security audit (even a basic pen test)
  - HIPAA compliance checklist review

  3. Use Existing Examples

  - Better Auth has examples you can build from
  - Look for open-source multi-tenant SaaS starters
  - Don't reinvent patterns that already exist

  4. Adjust Timeline Expectations

  - 6-8 weeks might be optimistic for solo development
  - Consider 10-12 weeks to include learning time
  - Or reduce scope to hit 6-8 week target

  5. Start with a Proof of Concept

  Before committing to the full MVP:
  // Week 1: Prove these work together
  - Better Auth + Next.js basic setup
  - Simple RLS policy test
  - Basic tRPC endpoint
  - If this takes more than a week, reassess

  Bottom Line:

  It's ambitious but not impossible. The key risks are:
  1. Multi-tenant security (this MUST be right)
  2. Timeline pressure leading to security shortcuts
  3. Compliance requirements adding complexity

  My advice: Start with a smaller slice to validate you can integrate all
  the pieces, then expand. The documentation we created is comprehensive -
  use it as a north star but don't feel you must implement everything in the
   first pass.

  Would you like me to create a "Phase 0" proof-of-concept plan that would
  let you validate the core architecture in 1-2 weeks before committing to
  the full MVP?

> my rationale for building this is that I will be using this auth service 
  with a multi-platform healthcare application where the security and 
  healthcare compliance complexities are already obligated and required. I 
  see this as a refactor more than a standalone idea. is it still worth my 
  effort?

⏺ This completely changes the equation - and makes this project not just
  worthwhile, but strategically essential. Here's why:

  Why This Makes Perfect Sense:

  1. You're Solving a Real, Existing Problem

  - You already have healthcare compliance obligations
  - Security requirements aren't theoretical - they're mandated
  - You're not building speculatively - you have a concrete use case

  2. Centralized Auth is the Right Architecture

  Current (likely) state:          Better approach:
  ┌─────────────────┐             ┌─────────────────┐
  │   Web App       │             │   Web App       │─┐
  │ (auth code)     │             └─────────────────┘ │
  └─────────────────┘                                 │
                                                      ├─→ MLPipes Auth
  ┌─────────────────┐             ┌─────────────────┐ │   Service
  │  Mobile App     │      vs     │  Mobile App     │─┘
  │ (auth code)     │             └─────────────────┘
  └─────────────────┘
                                  Single source of truth
  Duplicated auth logic           for compliance & security

  3. Compliance Benefits are Multiplied

  - One audit trail instead of multiple
  - One place to update for compliance changes
  - Consistent security across all platforms
  - Single point for security monitoring

  4. Development Efficiency Gains

  - Write authentication once, use everywhere
  - Update security policies in one place
  - Single codebase for compliance updates
  - Shared user management across platforms

  Why This is Less Risky Than It Seems:

  1. You Already Understand the Domain

  - You know what HIPAA requires
  - You understand healthcare workflows
  - You've dealt with these compliance needs
  - No learning curve on requirements

  2. Refactoring Reduces Risk

  - You can migrate gradually
  - Test with non-critical features first
  - Keep existing auth as fallback
  - Learn from current implementation's pain points

  3. ROI is Clear and Immediate

  - Every platform immediately benefits
  - Reduce duplicate security vulnerabilities
  - Simplify compliance reporting
  - Faster feature development

  Practical Approach for Your Situation:

  Phase 1: "Extraction Refactor" (Weeks 1-2)

  Instead of building from scratch, consider:
  // 1. Audit existing auth implementation
  - What works well?
  - What's duplicated across platforms?
  - What are the pain points?
  - Where are compliance gaps?

  // 2. Start with your existing auth logic
  - Extract common patterns
  - Identify platform-specific needs
  - Map to Better Auth features

  Phase 2: "Parallel Development" (Weeks 3-6)

  - Build auth service while existing auth still works
  - Test with read-only operations first
  - Gradually migrate features
  - Keep rollback path clear

  Phase 3: "Progressive Migration"

  // Low-risk migration path
  1. New user registrations → Auth service
  2. Password resets → Auth service
  3. Session validation → Auth service
  4. Existing user login → Auth service (with fallback)
  5. Complete migration

  Specific Benefits for Multi-Platform Healthcare:

  1. Mobile-Specific Wins

  - Biometric auth (Face ID/Touch ID) managed centrally
  - Session management across app updates
  - Offline token validation strategies
  - Push notification tokens tied to auth

  2. Healthcare Workflow Benefits

  - Single sign-on across platforms
  - Consistent timeout policies
  - Unified provider credentialing
  - Cross-platform audit trail

  3. Compliance Simplification

  - One codebase for HIPAA audits
  - Centralized BAA management
  - Single point for security patches
  - Unified incident response

  My Recommendation:

  Absolutely worth the effort because:

  1. You're not building in a vacuum - real need, real ROI
  2. Complexity is already required - not adding it, just organizing it
  3. Multi-platform amplifies benefits - write once, secure everywhere
  4. Technical debt reduction - stop duplicating auth logic

  Adjusted Approach:

  1. Start with extraction - pull out existing auth patterns
  2. Build incrementally - migrate platform by platform
  3. Measure success - track reduction in auth-related bugs
  4. Document patterns - your current pain points are valuable

  Would you like me to create a migration-focused plan that shows how to
  extract your existing auth into this service architecture? This would be
  more practical than building greenfield.

> one more question before creating a migration-focused plan. i know there 
  is a community out there than can also benefit from this as an open source
   project. i can also benefit from code contributions and pulls. if i 
  publish this under mit licence, how does this change the plan?

⏺ Open-sourcing this is a brilliant move that actually makes the project
  MORE valuable, not more complex. Here's how it changes everything:

  Why Open Source is Perfect for This Project:

  1. Healthcare Auth is a Shared Pain Point

  - Every healthcare startup faces the same compliance requirements
  - Most reinvent the wheel (poorly)
  - A well-done solution would be widely adopted
  - Better Auth + Healthcare is an unfilled niche

  2. Security Through Transparency

  // Open source benefits for security:
  - More eyes on security-critical code
  - Community penetration testing
  - Publicly verifiable compliance claims
  - Faster vulnerability discovery and patches

  3. Accelerated Development

  - Contributors who need specific features will build them
  - Healthcare devs understand the domain
  - Bug fixes from real-world usage
  - Community-driven compliance updates

  How This Changes the Plan:

  1. Architecture Decisions Become More Important

  // Design for extensibility from day one
  - Plugin architecture for auth methods
  - Configurable compliance modules
  - Clear extension points
  - Well-documented interfaces

  2. Code Quality Standards

  // Open source requirements:
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Clear contributing guidelines
  - Automated testing (GitHub Actions)
  - Semantic versioning
  - Security disclosure policy

  3. Project Structure Changes

  4. MVP Scope Adjustment

  Remove: Organization-specific features
  Add: Configuration and extensibility
  // Before: Hardcoded for your org
  const SESSION_TIMEOUT = 1800; // 30 minutes

  // After: Configurable with defaults
  const SESSION_TIMEOUT = config.get('session.timeout', 1800);

  5. Documentation-First Development

  - Every feature needs docs
  - API must be stable and versioned
  - Migration guides for breaking changes
  - Clear upgrade paths

  Strategic Benefits:

  1. Recruitment & Reputation

  - Attracts healthcare developers to your company
  - Establishes you as a healthcare tech leader
  - Makes hiring easier (devs already know your code)

  2. Compliance Community

  ## Community contributions we'd likely get:
  - SOC2 compliance modules
  - HITRUST documentation
  - International healthcare standards (NHS, etc.)
  - EHR-specific integrations
  - Audit report generators

  3. Enterprise Adoption Path

  - Companies can evaluate without sales calls
  - Self-hosted option reduces vendor concerns
  - Paid support/hosting as business model
  - Enterprise features as add-ons

  Recommended Approach for Open Source:

  Phase 0: "Foundation for Community" (Week 1)

  # Set up for open source from day one
  - GitHub repo with clear README
  - MIT LICENSE file
  - CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
  - Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions

  # MLPipes Auth Service

  **Open-source, compliance-first authentication for healthcare 
  applications**

  [![HIPAA Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/HIPAA-Ready-green.svg)]()
  [![SOC2 Type II](https://img.shields.io/badge/SOC2-Ready-green.svg)]()
  [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)]()

  Built on [Better Auth](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth) with
  healthcare-specific extensions for multi-tenant medical applications.

  ## Why MLPipes Auth?

  Every healthcare startup struggles with the same authentication
  challenges:
  - HIPAA compliance requirements
  - Multi-tenant data isolation
  - Audit trail obligations
  - Session timeout policies
  - Provider credentialing

  We've built this once, correctly, so you don't have to.

  ## Quick Start

  ```bash
  npx create-mlpipes-auth my-auth-service
  cd my-auth-service
  npm run dev

  Production Ready Features

  ✅ HIPAA-compliant audit logging (7-year retention)
  ✅ Multi-tenant isolation with PostgreSQL RLS
  ✅ Healthcare session policies (configurable timeouts)
  ✅ Provider credentialing support
  ✅ SMART on FHIR ready (coming soon)

  ## My Recommendation:

  **Absolutely go open source** because:
  1. **Shared problem = shared solution** - healthcare auth needs community
  2. **Security improves** with transparency
  3. **Development accelerates** with contributors
  4. **Business opportunities** emerge (support, hosting, consulting)
  5. **Reputation benefits** are substantial

  The key is to **design for community from day one** - make it extensible,
  well-documented, and easy to contribute to.

  Would you like me to create an open-source-focused migration plan that
  includes community building strategies and positions this for maximum
  adoption?

> when you say migration plan, what exactly do you mean?

⏺ Good question! Let me clarify what I mean by "migration plan" in your
  context:

  What I Mean by "Migration Plan"

  Since you mentioned this is a refactor of existing auth in your
  multi-platform healthcare app, I'm assuming you currently have:

  // Current state (my assumption):
  - Web app with some auth implementation
  - Mobile app(s) with auth implementation
  - Possibly duplicated auth logic
  - Existing users/sessions/data
  - Current compliance measures in place

  A migration plan would detail how to:

  1. Extract Your Existing Auth → New Service

  // Instead of starting from scratch:
  CURRENT: Auth logic inside each app
  ↓
  EXTRACT: Pull out common patterns
  ↓
  REFACTOR: Build auth service using those patterns
  ↓
  MIGRATE: Move apps to use new service

  2. Move Without Breaking Production

  // Phase 1: Read operations
  - New service validates tokens created by old system
  - Apps can check auth status via new service
  - Old system still creates sessions

  // Phase 2: Dual write
  - New registrations go to both systems
  - Login attempts check both systems
  - Gradual traffic shift

  // Phase 3: Full migration
  - Old system becomes read-only
  - All auth operations via new service
  - Migrate remaining data

  3. Handle Existing User Data

  -- Migration considerations:
  - Existing password hashes (can Better Auth read them?)
  - Current session tokens (how to honor them?)
  - User metadata (how to map to new schema?)
  - Audit logs (historical compliance data)

  But Maybe You Mean Something Else?

  If you're actually starting fresh (no existing auth to migrate), then by
  "migration plan" I might have misunderstood. In that case, you might want:

  A. Greenfield Implementation Plan

  - Build auth service from scratch
  - Design for your multi-platform needs
  - No legacy data to worry about

  B. Platform Integration Plan

  - How each platform will integrate
  - SDK/client library development
  - Platform-specific considerations

  C. Open Source Launch Plan

  - How to structure for community
  - Documentation and examples
  - Community building strategy

  Which Scenario Fits You?

  Option 1: "I have existing auth code to migrate"
  // You currently have:
  - Working auth in production
  - Users logging in today
  - Need to move without downtime
  → Need a true migration plan

  Option 2: "I'm building new apps"
  // You're starting with:
  - New healthcare platform
  - No existing users yet
  - Can build auth right from start
  → Need an implementation plan

  Option 3: "Mix of both"
  // You have:
  - Some existing apps with auth
  - Planning new apps too
  - Want consistent auth everywhere
  → Need hybrid approach

  Which scenario best describes your situation? This will help me create the
   most relevant plan for you.

> I fit option 2 scenario. i am now working on a healthcare mvp with better 
  auth integrated into my platform. with open source in mind, i think the 
  github publication will need documentation from a community contribution 
  point of view, while for my project, i do need a low risk plan to have an 
  mvp auth and later port my auth on my project to use a stand-alone self 
  hosted mlpipes-auth service.

⏺ Perfect! This makes the path much clearer. You need a two-stage approach:

  Your Two-Stage Strategy

  Stage 1: MVP with Embedded Better Auth (Now - Week 4)

  Build your healthcare MVP with Better Auth directly integrated, but
  structure it for easy extraction later.

  Stage 2: Extract to Standalone Service (Week 5-8)

  Pull out the auth into MLPipes Auth service and open source it, then point
   your MVP to use it.

  Stage 1: Smart MVP Implementation Plan

  Week 1-2: Auth Foundation with Extraction in Mind

  Key Principle: Write your auth code as if it's already a separate service.

  // ❌ DON'T: Tightly couple auth to your app
  app.post('/api/signup', async (req, res) => {
    const user = await db.user.create({...})
    await sendWelcomeEmail(user)
    await createPatientRecord(user) // App-specific logic mixed in
  })

  // ✅ DO: Keep auth isolated
  // src/lib/auth-service/index.ts (future MLPipes Auth)
  export class AuthService {
    async signUp(data: SignUpDto) {
      const user = await this.createUser(data)
      await this.sendVerificationEmail(user)
      await this.auditLog('USER_SIGNUP', user)
      return user
    }
  }

  // src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts (your app)
  export async function POST(req: Request) {
    const user = await authService.signUp(data)
    // App-specific logic separate
    await createPatientRecord(user)
    return Response.json(user)
  }

  Week 2-3: Core Healthcare Features

  Structure for future multi-tenant/compliance needs:

  // src/lib/auth-service/config.ts
  export const authConfig = {
    // These become configurable in open-source version
    session: {
      timeout: getEnv('SESSION_TIMEOUT', 1800),
      extendOnActivity: getEnv('SESSION_EXTEND', true)
    },

    password: {
      minLength: getEnv('PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH', 12),
      requireComplexity: getEnv('PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY', true)
    },

    compliance: {
      auditRetention: getEnv('AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS', 2555), // 7 years
      hipaaMode: getEnv('HIPAA_MODE', true)
    }
  }

  // src/lib/auth-service/audit.ts
  export class AuditLogger {
    async log(event: AuditEvent) {
      // Start simple, but use interface that scales
      await db.auditLog.create({
        ...event,
        // These fields prepare for multi-tenant
        organizationId: getContext().orgId || 'default',
        environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
      })
    }
  }

  Week 3-4: Complete MVP Auth

  Build with open-source patterns:

  // src/lib/auth-service/providers/email-password.ts
  export class EmailPasswordProvider implements AuthProvider {
    name = 'email-password'

    async authenticate(credentials: EmailPasswordCredentials) {
      // Implementation
    }
  }

  // src/lib/auth-service/plugins/two-factor.ts
  export class TwoFactorPlugin implements AuthPlugin {
    name = 'two-factor-totp'

    async setup(user: User) {
      // TOTP setup
    }
  }

  // This structure makes it easy to:
  // 1. Extract later
  // 2. Let community add providers/plugins
  // 3. Configure per deployment

  File Structure for Easy Extraction

  └── tests/
      └── auth-service/           # Test auth in isolation

  Stage 2: Extraction to Standalone Service

  Week 5-6: Extract and Package

  The extraction becomes mechanical:

  # 1. Copy auth-service to new repo
  cp -r your-app/src/lib/auth-service ~/mlpipes-auth/

  # 2. Add Better Auth as core dependency
  cd ~/mlpipes-auth
  npm install better-auth

  # 3. Wrap in service layer
  # Create API endpoints that your app will call

  Week 6-7: Open Source Preparation

  // Transform hardcoded values to configuration
  // Before (MVP):
  const SESSION_TIMEOUT = 1800

  // After (Open Source):
  const SESSION_TIMEOUT = config.get('session.timeout', 1800)

  // Add extension points
  export interface AuthServiceConfig {
    providers: AuthProvider[]
    plugins: AuthPlugin[]
    middleware: AuthMiddleware[]
    // Let users customize
  }

  // Document everything
  /**
   * MLPipes Auth Service
   * @description Healthcare-compliant authentication service
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const auth = new MLPipesAuth({
   *   providers: [new EmailPasswordProvider()],
   *   plugins: [new HIPAAAuditPlugin()],
   * })
   * ```
   */

  Week 7-8: Deploy and Migrate

  Your app migration is simple:

  // Before: Direct auth-service usage
  import { authService } from '@/lib/auth-service'

  // After: API calls to standalone service
  import { AuthClient } from '@mlpipes/auth-client'

  const authClient = new AuthClient({
    url: process.env.AUTH_SERVICE_URL
  })

  // Same interface, different transport
  await authClient.signUp(data)

  Benefits of This Approach

  1. Low Risk for Your MVP

  - Auth works from day one
  - No external dependencies initially
  - Proven Better Auth foundation
  - Can ship MVP quickly

  2. Easy Extraction Later

  - Clean separation from start
  - Well-tested auth logic
  - No rushed decisions
  - Gradual migration possible

  3. Open Source Ready

  - Built with patterns community expects
  - Extensible architecture
  - Clean interfaces
  - Documentation started early

  4. Real-World Testing

  - Your MVP proves the auth works
  - Find edge cases before open sourcing
  - Performance baseline established
  - Security tested in production

  Key Success Factors

  1. Maintain Separation

  // Always ask: "Would this make sense in standalone auth?"
  // If no, keep it in your app layer

  2. Think Multi-Tenant Early

  // Even if MVP is single tenant
  interface AuthContext {
    userId: string
    organizationId?: string // Optional now, required later
    role: string
  }

  3. Document As You Build

  // Write JSDoc comments now
  // They become your open-source docs later

  4. Test in Isolation

  // Test auth-service without app dependencies
  // These become your open-source test suite

  Would you like me to create a specific Week 1 implementation checklist
  that shows exactly how to structure your MVP auth code for easy extraction
   later?

> yes create a comprehensive plan how i would go about this. later on, when 
  i can extract this into it's own codebase in this pwd where we sit, i can 
  possibly publish this under mit license and that would need a community 
  focused requirements, plan, documentation, engagement rules etc. how does 
  that sound?

⏺ Excellent approach! Let me create a comprehensive plan that takes you from
   MVP to open source, with everything structured for easy extraction later.

       1207 +  This Week 1 implementation creates:
       1208 +  
       1209 +  **Monorepo Structure:**
       1210 +  ```
       1211 +  cari-saas/
       1212 +  ├── packages/
       1213 +  │   └── auth-service/          # ← Future MLPipes Auth 
            + (isolated)
       1214 +  │       ├── src/
       1215 +  │       ├── tests/
       1216 +  │       └── package.json       # Independent package
       1217 +  └── apps/
       1218 +      └── web/                   # ← Your CARIHealth web app
       1219 +          ├── lib/auth/          # Integration layer
       1220 +          ├── prisma/            # Database with auth tables
       1221 +          └── .env.local         # Auth configuration
       1222 +  ```
       1223 +  
       1224 +  **Benefits:**
       1225 +  - ✅ **Clean separation** between auth service and CARIHealth 
            + business logic
       1226 +  - ✅ **Monorepo benefits** while maintaining extraction 
            + readiness
       1227 +  - ✅ **Independent packages** make extraction mechanical
       1228 +  - ✅ **Healthcare compliance** built into auth from day one
       1229 +  - ✅ **CARIHealth branding** maintained in your app layer
       1230 +  
       1231 +  This foundation gives you a working healthcare auth system 
            + embedded in your CARIHealth SaaS MVP, but architected for easy 
            + extraction to open source MLPipes Auth later. The clean 
            + separation ensures you can build your MVP confidently while 
            + preparing for community contribution.
       1232 +  
       1233 +  The auth service package is already structured as if it's a 
            + separate npm package, making the future extraction to 
            + `@mlpipes/auth-service` straightforward.

⏺ ✅ Week 1 Implementation Checklist Updated for CARIHealth SaaS Monorepo

  I've updated the Week 1 implementation checklist to perfectly fit your
  cari-saas monorepo structure:

  🏗️ Updated Monorepo Structure

  New Structure:
  cari-saas/
  ├── packages/
  │   └── auth-service/              # ← Future @mlpipes/auth-service
  │       ├── src/                   # Clean, isolated auth logic
  │       ├── tests/                 # Independent test suite
  │       └── package.json           # @cari-saas/auth-service
  └── apps/
      └── web/                       # ← Your CARIHealth web app
          ├── lib/auth/index.ts      # Thin integration layer
          ├── prisma/schema.prisma   # Database with auth tables
          └── .env.local             # Auth configuration

  🔧 Key Changes Made

  1. Package Structure:
  - @cari-saas/auth-service as independent workspace package
  - Clean separation from CARIHealth business logic
  - Ready for extraction with minimal changes

  2. Integration Layer:
  - apps/web/lib/auth/index.ts - thin wrapper for your CARIHealth app
  - Keeps CARIHealth-specific logic separate from auth service
  - Clean imports: import { authService } from '@cari-saas/auth-service'

  3. Monorepo Scripts:
  // cari-saas root package.json
  "scripts": {
    "test:auth-service": "npm run test --workspace=@cari-saas/auth-service",
    "build:auth-service": "npm run build
  --workspace=@cari-saas/auth-service"
  }

  4. Environment & Database:
  - Environment variables in apps/web/.env.local
  - Database schema in apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
  - Migration commands from cari-saas/apps/web/

  5. CARIHealth Branding:
  - Email from: noreply@carihealth.com
  - Profile creation: createCARIHealthProfile()
  - Business logic: Healthcare provider vs patient profiles

  🚀 Benefits of This Structure

  For Your MVP:
  - ✅ Works immediately in your existing cari-saas monorepo
  - ✅ Monorepo benefits - shared tooling, dependencies, scripts
  - ✅ Clean separation - auth service has no CARIHealth coupling
  - ✅ Healthcare compliance built-in from day one

  For Future Open Source:
  - ✅ Easy extraction - cp -r packages/auth-service ~/mlpipes-auth/
  - ✅ Independent package - ready to publish as @mlpipes/auth-service
  - ✅ Clean interfaces - no breaking changes needed
  - ✅ Battle-tested - proven in production CARIHealth app

  📋 Ready to Start Week 1

  The updated checklist now gives you:
  1. Day 1: Monorepo package setup with clean boundaries
  2. Day 2: Better Auth integration with healthcare extensions
  3. Day 3: Database schema with multi-tenant support
  4. Day 4: CARIHealth web app integration layer
  5. Day 5: Testing and environment configuration

  You can begin implementing immediately in your cari-saas monorepo with
  confidence that extraction to open source will be straightforward later.

  The auth service package is designed as if it's already a standalone npm
  package - making the future transition to @mlpipes/auth-service mechanical
   rather than architectural.
