        **Please do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

        2. **Email**: Send details to security@hardy-auth.com
        3. **Encrypted Email**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

        Public security reports may be closed immediately and you will be asked to re-submit privately.
